## How to Run

Alternately, download the GitHub repository and open the index.html file in a browser to begin the game.

## How to Play

Begin by using the left and right arrow keys to highlight a character. Press enter to select
your character and begin the game.
Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move your character. The goal is to avoid the bugs that move across screen and reach the water. Each time you reach the water your score will increase and your character will return to the starting position. Watch out! The bugs will get faster the more your score grows. If a bug touches you, you will lose a life (shown on the top of the screen).  If you lose all lives you will receive a Game Over message and the game will reset.
